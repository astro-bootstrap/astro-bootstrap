add page astro prop to createPagination.ts to check for correct input

use active link for side menu on left
explain that components include non component usage insturctions, and manual usage if component include auto generation logic


react-bootstrap splits nav-item into nav item/link, is this worth it?

should rename dropdown.Link to Header? then make dropdown.Item contain a link by default, option of adding Button as a child to override?

add split button, check where its needed e.g. dropdown, nav dropdown. Automatically add <span class="visually-hidden">Toggle Dropdown</span> to split dropdown button

create barrel imports for all component groups e.g. accordion

can navs be reused in Tabs components? (not examples)

add nav variants to docs
  tabs?: boolean;
  pills?: boolean;
  justified?: boolean;
  fill?: boolean;

change structure so the components can be used individually, create examples of usage
pagination type for 'page'
type for { markdown } = Astro.props

content collections - force frontmatter schema

offcanvas: child dropdown js not functioning

add the following js controlled components:

- collapse
- dropdowns
- modal
- offcanvas
- scrollspy (easy) with link to source for TOC?
