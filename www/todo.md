react-bootstrap splits nav-item into nav item/link, is this worth it?

should rename dropdown.Link to Header? then make dropdown.Item contain a link by default, option of adding Button as a child to override?

add split button, check where its needed e.g. dropdown, nav dropdown. Automatically add <span class="visually-hidden">Toggle Dropdown</span> to split dropdown button

create barrel imports for all component groups e.g. accordion

can navs be reused in Tabs components? (not examples)

add nav variants to docs
  tabs?: boolean;
  pills?: boolean;
  justified?: boolean;
  fill?: boolean;

change structure so the components can be used individually, create examples of usage
pagination type for 'page'
type for { markdown } = Astro.props

content collections - force frontmatter schema
